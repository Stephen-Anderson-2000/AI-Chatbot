# AI-Chatbot
Chatbot Created in Python for my Final Year AI Module

Information about the modules and which ones were installed using Pip can be seen in Bike-Chatbot.py

Unfortunately due to the nature of requiring public, unprotected details for Azure Services the original repository will remain private but this new one has never had the details added to it and so can be made available. It would be possible to create new Azure services and credentials causing the chatbot to then work correctly, as long as the new details are inside a file called Required-Files/Azure-Details.txt and follow the format set out inside Bike-Chatbot.py such as:
	key
	endpoint
	region

Video demonstration of the final part of the chatbot relating to the azure services is available; there are links to all of the demonstrations at the bottom of the Design Document
