progessive access,"The progressive access scheme allows a rider to hold a valid UK licence of the preceding category for two years before going to the next licence category. For example, at 21 you can do just the practical tests for the A licence if you have held your A2 license for two years instead of needing a valid theory and CBT certificate as well. This allows for the minimum age of the A licence to actually be 21 instead of 24."
