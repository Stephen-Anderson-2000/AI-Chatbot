Uses the "Vehicle" dataset available from https://www.kaggle.com/sabrinahikariyamauti/vehicle

The dataset consists of a total of about 36,000 images making up 17 classes.

I have cherry picked the image classes to reduce the number of images to around 11,000 images making up just 7 classes.

I have removed the following classes:
	Ambulance
	Barge
	Boat
	Cart
	Caterpillar (literally caterpillars, the animal)
	Limousine
	Segway
	Snowmobile
	Tank
	Taxi
Which leaves the following classes:
	Bicycle
	Bus
	Car
	Helicopter
	Motorcycle
	Truck
	Van
